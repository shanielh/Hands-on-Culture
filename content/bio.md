Hi there, I’m Shani Elharrar—a software engineer and engineering group leader
based in Israel. I work mostly on backend
systems and distributed data processing.

I enjoy growing teams and leaders, and turning real-world engineering challenges into simple, usable products.

I currently lead the engineering group at Upsolver, where we build data lake
infrastructure and streaming pipelines. I've mostly worked with high-level languages like Scala
(❤️), Kotlin, and C#, and I’m especially interested in profiling, observability,
and making systems easier to reason about.

I'm available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shanielh/), by email
at _shani_ at _handsonculture_ dot _blog_.
